                    This track was recorded in a similar fashion to BFG, on the same trip. The main guitar take and drums were recorded simultaneously, with the amp in the next room. This track has an excellent live feel and plenty of expressive pushing and pulling by Sean on drums. We did a few top to tail takes, picked the best one, and ended up not needing to comp down our main take at all. Overdubs were done in a similar fashion to BFG, with lots of layers on guitars and vocals. I battled with some noise on this track. With the softer performance compared to other things we were doing that day, we could have gained up the preamps more to reduce the S/N ratio. I employed some noise gates and careful editing to remedy this. We had tracked almost everything with room mics, which sounded great, but due to the noise, I cut as many unnecessary tracks as I could, so a lot of these room mics aren’t heard in the final mixdown. I instead used some software reverb, which gave the track a dreamier, ethereal feel, which ultimately is an effect I really enjoy for this track and ended up being really happy with. This track is super dynamic and has a lot of moving pieces , and this mix does a great job at highlighting that movement and creating depth.
