                    This live recording is from Velour’s annual Cowboys and Indies, the stems were acquired from Fern at velour, who was on sound that night. This set was also recorded with a video cassette recorder that had some pretty substandard audio, so acquiring the stems to do my own mix was super valuable. As expected with a live set, there were some issues. The kick sound was pretty undesirable, So I sample replaced the entire track with something a little more usable. There was some terrible noise on the snare mic, bad enough I couldn’t sample replace it easily, so I dealt with it with selective EQ and noise gating. As expected with using primarily dynamic mics it sounded a little dull, I compensated that with boosting some high end across a few sources. The room mics sounded good, and are fairly present in the final mixdown. Guitars also suffered from some proximity effect boominess, but that was remedied with some EQ. Overall a really fun project.                 </div>
