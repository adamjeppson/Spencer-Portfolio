                    This band is incredible. Working with them was an absolute pleasure. This is their song Deadpoint, recorded live in their bassist’s basement. I and one other engineer compiled together a rig and set up mics to record this on location. This is a project I would do a little bit differently given the opportunity. At the time the band did not own an acoustic upright bass, which would have been a much better option than the electric standup they had at the time. I have it work regardless and the bass sounds good, just not quite like an acoustic upright would have. We were also fighting with some clicking, I suspect was caused by some bad power or electrical interference. This take worked out okay and only had one instance of a notable issue in a rather unfortunate place. Ultimately the goal of this project was to demo songs for future recording ventures and for this purpose, it was a success. I kept a copy of the stems and completed this mixdown to include in my portfolio.                     </div>
