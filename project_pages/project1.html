                <div id="bio-text">This song was written by Sam and Davis of Mom Dad & Me. We spent some time at a house by a lake and set up a tracking studio in the basement. Selecting mic choices and placements was a collaborative effort, letting our ears dictate what to use and where to put it. The main Guitar take, Bass, and Drums were recorded simultaneously to give it a live feel and allow for some tempo push and pull. We did 3 or 4 top to tail takes and picked the best one with super minimal comping. Musicians played in the drum room with amplifiers in adjacent rooms to control bleed. Lots of room mics on almost everything recorded helped provide depth and make everything sound home-y and alive. Overdubs were mostly completed at the same space, with some additional overdubs done in a recording studio / storage shed the band owns. This mix came together super well, Sam is a really tight vocalist and his doubles sound really great. Lots of layers on guitar and vocals really helped pull everything together. Some automation to bring up the drum overheads and bring out the background vocals helped the second verse sound a little rowdier, an effect I really enjoyed. Super happy with this final mix, I think the mix amplifies the nostalgia present in the songwriting.                    </div>
