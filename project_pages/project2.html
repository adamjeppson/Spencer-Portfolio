                    Haunt Audio is my venture into low voltage audio circuitry. The initial goal wasto build effects pedals for guitar and bass to fill needs that I and others I knew had. It has turned into a small business, offering repairs and custom order builds. I have had the opportunity to perform small repairs on gear such as amplifiers, cassette recorders, and effects pedals. I frequently perform pickup swaps or full custom rewires on electric guitars and basses. I also have worked with musicians to custom build effect pedals to fit specific needs and match their genre, playing style, and rig to a circuit we think will meet those needs. I use the <a id="bio-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/haunt.audio?igsh=MTVieXZ5M2piZDU0aw==" target="_blank">@haunt.audio</a> instagram page to promote my work as well as document repairs I have performed. That Instagram page serves as my portfolio for my audio hardware work. I do a good job of keeping that updated and have a goal to post one demo video per week. I have been invited to sell pedals at vendor markets such as Power Chord Guitar Festival this April in Orem, and High Desert Luthiery Invitational this May in Albuquerque, NM. I have built nearly 50 effects pedals, and have a growing artist roster of bands in the local scene, as well as smaller touring bands who play circuits that I have built.
