            <div id="bio-text">Hello, I am Spencer Jeppson, a prospective DAPR student at UVU. I have been attending UVU for 3 years with the goal of applying for the audio program and completion of a bachelor's degree in digital audio. I am currently employed at The Covey Center for the Arts as an Audio Engineer in their 680 seat theatre. I build and repair audio effects and hardware as <a id="bio-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/haunt.audio?igsh=MTVieXZ5M2piZDU0aw==" target="_blank">Haunt Audio</a>
                and intend to further my progression in hardware and circuit design and implementation, with goals to design and hand build small batch boutique audio effects. I am currently working towards designing and releasing self produced effects on custom ordered PCB’s, handbuilt in small batches. I am an active participant in the local music scene, playing bass in a couple bands. Upon graduation, I intend to seek employment in a studio setting, working with musicians to engineer and produce music. My long term career goals include a lifelong commitment to audio immersion and learning.  I will continue creating, building, modifying, and  repairing audio gear as long as I’m able to hold a soldering iron. I plan to continue Haunt Audio and design and release a line of handbuilt pedals that is focused on putting high quality and unique effects into the hands of musicians who are pushing boundaries of what music sounds like. I admire and look up to producers in the punk /  hardcore scene such as Will Yip, Jon Markson, Seth Henderson and Brett Romnes. I intend to work towards a career in producing music in this specific sphere, working with bands in this genre and scene.
